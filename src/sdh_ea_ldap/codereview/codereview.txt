Description:        Since the Management Service is updating hisself when
                    attribute "hobgwwsp" (important for clusters) is updated, the 
                    EA LDAP does not have to communicate with Man. Service anymore.

Description:        1) if we are creating a new domain we check with the new function 
                    "bool m_is_new_subdomain( ds_hstring* ahstr_dn, ds_hstring* ahstr_name )"
                    if our LDAP is OpenDS and if we are under "dc=root".
                    If true, then we write some special ACIs in this created domain with
                    the function "int m_write_domain_aci( ds_hstring* hstr_dn )".
                    If the autocreation tag in the wsp.xml is ON/YES, then we
                    create afterwards a new domainAdmin group with the function
                    "bool m_create_dadmin_group( ds_hstring* hstr_dn )".
                    2) If our LDAP is OpenDS and if we are in the domainAdmin group,
                    then we set some additional rights for an user, who is added 
                    to this group (bool m_set_add_rights( ds_hstring* dsl_user_dn )).
                    Analogical we delete the rights, if an user is removed from
                    this group bool (m_del_add_rights( ds_hstring* dsl_user_dn )).

SVN-Revision:       2760

Description:        1) added the reading of the domain-admin tag from the wsp.xml
                    Set appropriate access control instructions (aci) for the
                    domains under dc=root; if a new domain is created in our
                    integrated LDAP server under dc=root, particular aci statements
                    are added to this domain
                    2) Depending on the value of the autocreation tag in the wsp.xml
                    we have to create the organizational unit and a new group
                    3) We have to give every user who is in the domainAdmin group
                    some special additional rights. So he gets the rights if he 
                    is created directly in this group or moved up to this group.
                    On the other side we have to delete this rights, if an user
                    is removed from this group.
                    4) modified the config-section in order to read the new entries
                    of the tag <domainadministrator-group>

Affected Files:     ds_config.cpp
                    ds_config.h
                    ds_ea_ldap.cpp
                    ds_ea_ldap.h
                    sdh_ea_ldap.h
