from now on, one can set <login-cookie> in a role section of the wsp.xml.

Comment:
Increased the buffer for role configurations from 16 KB to 2096 KB = 2 MB
Mr. Grimm wrote that KIRU will have 1500 roles, with an average of 1400 Bytes per role.
There is written that Mr. Brandstätter doesnt want dynamic memory allocation, so this
is the only way i can fix it right now. If a customer has only 5 roles, then a lot
of memory is unused...

Comment:	there is a loop in the webserver dll, in function get_mgmt_parents.
			i couldnt reproduce the loop, but it seems that the outer loop function
			was causing the problems. the only thing which could lead to a loop was,
			that some entries in the mgmt table are referring to themselves
			( for example: a -> b -> c -> a ... )
			i now implemented a check that counts the amount of entries available and
			break the loop if this is reached. it does NOT solve the problem that
			the chain is referring wrong, but this can only be solved if the problem
			can be reproduced in a debug version.
