Comment:
     o when a second instance of nbipgw20 was started, the TCPComp started to loop.
        Now the event POLLHUP is handled in m_tpcthread.

Comment:
     o Mr. Wittinger queried the correctness of the '<=' sign in the
       loop over dsr_tcpconn (line 5730).
       Statement Mr. A. Kretzschmar:
       In order to read() and write() events under Linux we have to
       create a so called pipe event. Therefore we start the loops
       over dsr_tcpconn in Linux with im_conn = 1. The variable 
       im_concount contains the number of active connections. Because
       of this 'special' [0] element counting starts with im_conn = 1, 
       and thus the loop runs up tp "im_conn <= im_concount". Otherwise 
       the last connection would not be considered. Therefore the variable 
       dsr_tcpconn contains [TCPCOMP_MAXCONN + 1] elements, see line 3420.

Comment:
	 o The function m_build_conf_01() seems unecessarily
	   complex and large for the task at hand: parse a
	   configuration file and apply its contents.
	   ~6000 lines for a function that not performance critical
	   is masive!
	 o Coding standards, 3.2. Numbered variables in large
	   functions are not short lived.
	 o The amount of duplicated/redundant XML processing in code
	   is large. Lines 2749-3086
	 o Coding standards, section 4.6. The use of goto is not fully
	   rationalized (m_conf_conn()!).
	 o Lots of duplicate code from line 8216-8427
	 o Coding standards, 4.19
Review status: pass (legacy code)

Comment:
	 o Coding standards 1.11, header contains more than just
	   definitions (~6000 lines!). It contains member functions that
	   should go into a .cpp file.
	 o Unusual construct on line 5730, loop over dsr_tcpconn with
	   im_conn <=(!) im_concount. Which value does im_concount
	   have when the array is full? I think, len + 1.
	   Possible reference of an uninitialized object?
	   And why does the loop start with 1?
