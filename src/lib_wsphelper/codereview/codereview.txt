Description:
    time_t ds_wsp_helper::m_cb_get_time()
    Ticket 34385: Although t_ret is (currently) a 64bit variable, it is being truncated
    to 32bit inside the DEF_AUX_GET_TIME in WSP, and then implicitly casted to 64bit in RDVPN.
    This leads to an unsafe behaviour of the higher 4 bytes of t_ret, and therefore,
    this can lead to an incorrect evaluation of its value by the callers of this function.
    Casting it to an unsigned integer corrects the value of the higher 4 bytes by
    putting all of them to 0.

SVN-Revision:       2485

Description:
   Added some easy to use
        "ds_wsp_helper::m_open_file",
        "ds_wsp_helper::m_read_file" and
        "ds_wsp_helper::m_close_file"
   functions. They aren't the fastest way to open and read a file using WSP
   (because there allocation a filehandle object), but they make if easier.

Affected Files:
   include/ds_wsp_helper.h
   src/ds_wsp_helper.cpp
